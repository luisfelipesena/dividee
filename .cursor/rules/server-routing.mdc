# Server-Side Routing

The server uses an Express router with a feature-based structure.

The main router file is [`apps/server/src/routes.ts`](mdc:apps/server/src/routes.ts). This file imports and mounts the feature-specific routers.

## Feature Routers

- **Authentication**: Handled in [`apps/server/src/routes/auth.routes.ts`](mdc:apps/server/src/routes/auth.routes.ts).
- **Subscriptions**: Handled in [`apps/server/src/routes/subscriptions.routes.ts`](mdc:apps/server/src/routes/subscriptions.routes.ts).

When adding new endpoints, please follow this pattern by either adding to an existing feature router or creating a new one for a new feature.
