# Monorepo Structure Guide

This is a pnpm monorepo. The structure is managed by [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml).

## Applications (`apps/`)

The `apps` directory contains the deployable applications:

- **`apps/mobile`**: The React Native/Expo mobile application for users.
- **`apps/server`**: The Express.js backend server that provides the API for the mobile app.
- **`apps/web`**: A placeholder Next.js application for a future web interface.

## Shared Packages (`packages/`)

The `packages` directory contains code shared across the applications:

- **`packages/types`**: Shared TypeScript types and interfaces, ensuring consistency between the server and client applications.
